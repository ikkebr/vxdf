# VXDF Integration Progress

## Completed Steps

1. **Created Backend API Layer**
   - Created `api.py` in the engine with endpoints for the frontend
   - Added data transformation functions to convert backend models to frontend format
   - Implemented CORS support for cross-origin requests
   - Added Flask-CORS dependency to the backend

2. **Updated Backend Configuration**
   - Registered the API Blueprint in `main.py`
   - Added proxy configuration for development
   - Updated dependency list in `pyproject.toml`

3. **Updated Frontend API Client**
   - Replaced mock API calls with real HTTP requests to the backend
   - Added proper error handling and loading states
   - Implemented data transformation for API responses

4. **Updated Frontend UI Components**
   - Modified the `App.tsx` to use the real API client
   - Enhanced the `FileUpload.tsx` component with parser type selection
   - Added error handling UI in the main application
   
5. **Added Development Configuration**
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` with API proxy settings
   - Created documentation on how to run the integrated system

## Next Steps

1. **Testing the Integration**
   - Test the file upload functionality
   - Test the vulnerability listing and filtering
   - Test the dashboard statistics

2. **Enhancing the Frontend**
   - Add a VulnerabilityDetails component to view detailed information about a vulnerability
   - Implement pagination for the vulnerability list
   - Add filters for vulnerability type, severity, and exploitability status

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement proper authorization for API endpoints

4. **Containerization**
   - Create a Dockerfile for the integrated application
   - Create a docker-compose.yml for easy deployment

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment workflows

## Known Issues and Considerations

1. **API Response Format**
   - The backend API returns data in a different format than what the frontend expects in some cases.
   - The transformation functions handle this, but more testing is needed.

2. **Error Handling**
   - More robust error handling is needed, especially for file upload and parsing errors.

3. **Performance**
   - For large scan files, the synchronous processing might cause timeouts.
   - Consider adding asynchronous processing with progress updates.

4. **Security**
   - The API currently doesn't have authentication or authorization.
   - File uploads should be validated more thoroughly for security.

## Running the Integrated Solution

To run the integrated solution in development mode:

1. Start the backend:
```bash
# From the project root directory
cd api
python main.py
```

Or use the provided script:
```bash
# From the project root directory
./scripts/start.sh
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
